Installing through Conda (miniconda)
------------------------------------

Download and install `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_.

Run the following command to install the required packages:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install -c conda-forge git cxx-compiler m2w64-toolchain libblas libpython

Stable release
--------------

To install `PyCMTensor`, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pycmtensor

This is the preferred method to install `PyCMTensor`, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

We recommend using `Conda`_ as the dependency and package manager.

From sources
------------

The sources for PyCMTensor can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/mwong009/pycmtensor

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -OJL https://github.com/mwong009/pycmtensor/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, `cd` to the repo directory and install with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd pycmtensor
    $ make install
