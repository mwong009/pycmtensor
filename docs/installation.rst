Installing through Conda (miniconda)
------------------------------------

Download and install `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_.

Run the following command to install the required packages:

To install PyCMTensor, you need `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ (Full Anaconda works fine, but **miniconda** is recommmended for a minimal installation). Ensure that Conda is using at least `Python 3.9`.

Once Conda is installed, install the required dependencies from conda by running the following command in your terminal:

Windows:

.. code-block:: console

    conda install mkl-service conda-forge::cxx-compiler conda-forge::m2w64-toolchain -y

Mac OS X:

.. code-block:: console

    conda install mkl-service Clang

Linux:

.. code-block:: console

    conda install mkl-service conda-forge::cxx-compiler


Stable release
--------------

Run this command in your terminal to download and install the latest branch of `PyCMTensor` from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pycmtensor/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install pycmtensor -U

This is the preferred method to install `PyCMTensor`, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

*Optional*: If you want the development version from the Github repository:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install git+https://github.com/mwong009/pycmtensor.git@develop -U

We recommend using `Conda`_ as the dependency and package manager. 

.. _Conda: https://https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.pypa.io


Development
-----------

The sources for PyCMTensor can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

.. code-block:: console

    git clone git://github.com/mwong009/pycmtensor

To set up `PyCMTensor` in a local development environment, you need to set up a virtual environment and install the project requirements. Follow the instructions to install Conda (miniconda), then start a new virtual environment with the provided `environment_<your OS>.yml` file.

For example in windows:

.. code-block:: console

    conda env create -f environment_windows.yml

Next, activate the virtual environment and install poetry via `pip`.

.. code-block:: console

    conda activate pycmtensor-dev
    pip install poetry

Lastly, install the project and development dependencies

.. code-block:: console

    poetry install -E dev
